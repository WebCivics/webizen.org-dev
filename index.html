							<h2>History of Webizen</h2>
	<!-- This section is too long -it needs to be updated / shortened -->
							<p>Webizen was the name produced to support a search-engine that made discoverable the WebIDs of those (who had been) involved with producing a decentralised way of managing information associated to legal entities. The term is definable via various means including <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen">the urban dictionary</a> which illustrates its purpose in association to the concept of 'citizen' (and not slave); in addition to the related <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webizen">Webizen w3c works</a> that is also reflected
							on <a href="https://twitter.com/W3C_Webizen">Twitter</a> and formerally also facebook. After some disruptive community events, the webizen.org domain was secured for future use via a project that would seek to better dignifies the efforts made by a group of people to improve the circumstances of humanity via web related liberal arts. The now defunct 'original' <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140325150328/http://webizen.org:80/">webizen website</a> provided a means to identify who was involved in early Read-Write Web (RWW) / 'Solid' works, operated without 'bans' or other similar forms of editorialship. the writings of those involved can be found on the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rww/">RWW List</a>.</p>
							<p>Historically, the community was focused on the means for people to operate their own data environment, that was primarily powered via a Semantic Web technology ecosystem. Complimentary tooling was produced to support various - as yet unsupported - requirements (ie: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">Payments</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/cg/">Web Of Things (IoT)</a>, etc.), yet, what was thought of as the intended outcome - has not materially occurred - yet.</p>
							<p>Whilst even Tim Berners-Lee himself, prioritised the importannce of addressing the broad-ranging implications of this seemingly inexorable problem by establishing <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/about">Inrupt</a>, competitive alternatives that do not support human agency in a similar way, that employed much of the language we developed throughout this journey - have rolled out globally, as 'Web3', whilst so many members of our human family continued to face harmful situations that they're unable to address better due to information management policies deployed, that are fundamentally not - democratised.</p>
							<p>In my opinion, in a world of 7.8 Billion people (or so); there are very few who've dedicated the time and energy required by highly skilled persons, to better define the 'open (patent pool provided for) royalty free standards' that are instrumental to our present and future global communications mediums (built upon the 'world wide web') in a way that suppports more than simply commercial entities; but rather, mankind and our natural world moreover.  These people are often not only unpaid, but without dignified consideration for how it is they've spent many years of their lives, in service to humanity (if not, to major corporations globally without appropriate compensation on core technologies they require and use globally, consequentially).  Part of the answer to this problem was intended to be 'webizen, which my use of this site seeks to dignify appropriately (whilst not in the same, historical way).</p>

							<p>The concept of Webizen is now being re:defined via this project, to deliver an outcome that appears to me, to be manifestly compatible with the shared vision many involved at that time, appeared to share, about our desires for our works to be employed for the good of humanity at large.</p>

							<h2>A real-world future for Webizens</h2>
							<p>The Basic "refreshed" Concept of a Webizen, is that it is a class of Active Artificial Agent, otherwise known as a software <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_Agent">agent</a>, that is owned by its human (its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_(commercial_law)">Principal</a>) to support the needs of their owner, particularly in their private capacity as a natural person and most often also, citizen.</p>
						<!-- Too long -->
							<p>Whilst the webizen Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AiOS) is to be produced as an open-source, inspectable, cooperatively / collaboratively developed & maintained platform environment that can be downloaded for installation on suitable hardware, the broader goal is to produce a solution that people can buy for themselves & their family, at major retailers; that comes in a specially designed 'box' that they own as their property, as they would if they bought themselves a vault.</p>
							<p>In future, it is hoped that major infrastructure providers (ie: telecommunications corporations, Banks, etc) will see the merits of providing human beings - digital agency & support for rights (not simply rulers); and willl in-future figure out how to support enterprise hosted versions, that are provided on the same basic humanitarian principals. However this objective has not yet been supported by the market, and is not expected to be better understood until after, we've democratised Ai via Webizen & similar alternatives elsewhere in the market.</p>

							<h2>The Future for Webizens</h2>
							<p>The future of Webizen, is about the creation of the first 'webizen', defined to support human dignity and our values as natural persons, to bind upon non-biosphere agents who all too often seek 'rent seeking' opportunities, without doing enough to support our needs - particularly if or when we're in a situation that means, we really need some help from our #RealityCheckTech, that's now absent. So, its upon those who are part of our natural world to do something about it, and we're looking for good incorporated 'citizens' who are interested in becoming part of this journey with us.  Part of this challenge, is about how to discover 'good agents', which this site hopes to be part of what is being made to help achieve those goals.</p>

							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-address-book"></span>
									<h3>Address Book</h3>
									<p>If its even going to be possible to turn all those services off or at least ensure your life doesn't depend upon them, then its important you have the means to make, manage and own your own AddressBook. Your addressbook can be curated by you and ensures you're able to connect with others by mutual consent, on your own terms.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-save"></span>
									<h3>Personal 'data' ownership</h3>
									<p>Whilst the technicalities do get complex, the underlying intent is to ensure the beneficial owner of the information that is stored and how it is used by AI to influence your experiences; that this information is owned and controlled by you.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-calendar-check"></span>
									<h3>Calendar & Scheduling</h3>
									<p>Providing the ability to make schedules for yourself and with others, automatically linking any booked appointments you may have made and providing the ability to look back at what you've been doing, how you've been spending your time and whether you've managed to meet or exceed your real-world goals.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-clipboard-list"></span>
									<h3>To Do Tracking</h3>
									<p>The ability to create a 'bucket-list' of things you want to do, things may be interested in doing and a means to make a log of the sorts of things you have been doing, so you can look back at it and see what you've been doing with your life.</p>
									<p> If you're anything like me, there's a bunch of things i think i'd like to do, but often stuggle to get around to actually doing it. 'to do' tracking, helps people identify the sorts of things they think they might want to do, as well as providing technology support to provide suggestions people may not have thought of without a little AI Assistance. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-award"></span>
									<h3>Credentials & Awards</h3>
									<p>We get rewarded so much for engaging with the virtual world, where's the reward for switching it off to do stuff in the real-world; well, this is a big part of how this ecosystem is looking to forge a valued alternative to whats already 'online'. As much as is practical, every time there's an achievement, you'll rack-up rewards to remind you of your successes, and help you think about some of the things you might want to add to your collection.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-bolt"></span>
									<h3>Activity Support</h3>
									<p>The hardest thing i've found about trying to 'turn it off' is the next step - ok, what now...? </p>
									<p>So amongst the most essential elements to this entire idea, this entire plan - is that the platform will provide 'connectivity' & support between real-world people and real-world experiences.  Some may be free, some may be DIY, some may require bookings; and some may have special conditions. intent.eco is like a dating app, for finding stuff to do - in the real-world.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-brain"></span>
									<h3>Advanced AI</h3>
									<p>There is a vitally important consideration about how these tools are being designed to work, and perhaps most importantly; how AI is being designed to work - for <b>You</b>.  In-effect, this AI platforms works for you. The Intent is that your AI helper is entirely private to you, designed to be your secret-agent that is able to help you, as defined by you, make use of advanced technology to improve your life.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Community Support</h3>
									<p>The platform redefines how social-relationships are categorised whilst providing the means for people to be encouraged to connect and make use of technology to socialise and do things that are about the real-world, and not so much getting 'hooked' online, taking ever more physical and emotional time away from the natural world.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-exclamation-triangle"></span>
									<h3>Emergency Channel Support</h3>
								<p>intent.eco incorporates considerations about making various classifications of 'emergency alerts' to be supported by the platform.  This may include family emergencies sent by selected others, in addition to major governmental emergency notification providers. (whilst its expected that if there's a really significant problem, they can send an SMS...)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-globe"></span>
									<h3>Inter-Domestic</h3>
									<p>In-order to support the needs of real-world people in our natural world, our solution works to deliver an inter-domestically federated framework. The intent.eco platform is designed to be an inter-domestic solution. Members make accounts in their 'home country' (where they live), which can work in other regions; providing a base or home, for people to use as a safe foundation to engage in our diverse world of culture, knowledge and so many different possible experiences.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Safe & Secure</h3>
									<p>Whilst intent.eco is a commercial & propriatary product; We are committed to the highest levels of safety and security.  part of what this means is that whilst the platform is not open-source licensed and/or freely available for anyone to copy to build their own competitive alternatives, the source-code for the toolset is intended to be inspectable so that the 'super-geeks' can ensure, to the best of all of our ability; the platform is safe, secure (and extensible, by Members).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Natural World Advocacy</h3>
									<p>There are an array of strategies, solutions and ideas intent.eco is hoping to bring about an array of very positive influences, from rewards for tree-planting events and similar sorts of engagement with our world, through to looking at how IF this idea becomes financially successful; we might be able to help fund more works to improve the circumstances of our natural world...</p>
